# Syndemics-in-Common-Chronic-Conditions
## Objective
This is a study to determine how syndemic theory has been incorporated into research conducted in Chicago in the past decade.Â The syndemic theory focuses on how the social conditions impacts the diseases. In particular the study will try to determine if two or more diseases are clustered within specific communities.Syndemic is a complex interrelationship between two or more disease conditions, influenced by contextual and social factors.

## Hypothesis
Syndemic theory remains limited in health equity especially in urban areas such as Chicago, where achieving health equity continues to be a complex issue.
